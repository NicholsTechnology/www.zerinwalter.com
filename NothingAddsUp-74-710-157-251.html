<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Welcome to: A long boring thing I typed.</h3>


<p style="font-family:verdana">So in my mind, nothing really adds up in this situation. In my view, there is a very confusing amount of stuff that happened within a confusing time frame.  About 2 months ago, we were talking in my room, chilling. I don't know what you recall but we were on my bed and you totally kissed me 3 times on the cheek. Skip forward a month, give or take, now I'm in crisis. I went to you because I had nobody else. After we talked, I think I remember you saying something about us remaining friends and nothing more. Now, skip another month, give or take, you are thinking about us getting back together. I am missing all the context in between times so that's my main reasoning for making this, but I have so many questions. What really happened to Cedrick? Is there anyone else? How long would it ever last if we tried again? How the hell do you even like me, even Dawson tells me I'm a terrible person. It just doesn't make any sense how any of that works. But then again, being with you was one of the few things in my life I appreciated. It may have gone faster than normal but it was great and I realized that there was no getting over you, so I never even tried to be honest. Also, what did I do wrong when we were together at first? And what happened to your great affection with Cedrick? You said during the time I was in Florida ar maybe after that "he has my heart", or "love at first sight", Something along those lines. But then I think back to the VERY beginning. When we were in the band room, we were comparing heights. When I first put my arm on you, I was totally baffled. I would NEVER make physical contact with anybody, intentionally. And that's when I realized, that girl, Allyssa Miller is awesome. And it only got better, hanging out in Jazz with Skyla, and when I asked you out by the doors that exit the band room. I remember that you hesitated for a second, it scared the shit out of me. But then you nodded, and that was the beginning of us. Then we did stuff people in relationships do, for however long we were together. And then a bomb went off, or at least il felt like it. You had broken up with me. Then I actually read the reasoning and was ok. Then a while later I just knew it wasn't just going to be a mental health break, but a long boring realization that there was another guy. And then in Florida, my ass got introduced to Cedrick. ouch. Well, I thought it was for sure the end there because you were all going into lots of detail about how much you like this guy and I'm just sitting there. 14 stories high, drunk, stoned, and heartbroken. I didn't do anything drastic though I did what I do best. I played my baritone. I made a song. I never really wrote any of the notes down, but I played it. It was a sad song. Then I got heartburn  and went to sleep. I woke up and felt like shit. But then I finally accepted that was it. Skip back to modern time, I DOS ed the entire school system, skip a bit and now I'm here. Confused. Wow, I got really into detail on this lol.
